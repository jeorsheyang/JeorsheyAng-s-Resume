        <div class="subheading mb-5">Microbiology MajorðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently a second-year Microbiology major at University of California, Riverside. Previously attending STEM (science, technology, engineering, and medicine/mathematics)-based schools in Los Angeles, CA I became interested and wanted to invest my time into exploring the medical field. Especially with the help of my family members who are currently in the medical field, I've been able to study the sciences in college. Due to my interest in the medical field, over the past years I've spent my time at the Kaiser Permanente hospital in Los Angeles where I was taught medical skills by a medical professional. There I learned about many diseases, got an idea of moral and ethical medical debates doctors and nurses face, and skills such as suturing, performing physical examinations, and CPR. I also joined medical and humanitarian clubs in school like Girls Build LA, HOSA which stands for Health Occupations Students of America, and STEM 4 Humanity. Within these clubs I was able to reach out to the community, bringing awareness towards illnesses that may seem miniscule and aren't taken seriously through information booths, presentations, games, and giving out supplies in hopes of helping them. Many communities don't have the resources needed or have access to medical supplies because they're too expensive or because they simply do not know sbout them. So, I also learned and studied about the health occupations and skills needed. With all the knowledge and skills I gained, I was able to take part in health fairs organized by students and ultimately make a difference. <br><br>

        After my first year of college, I became a Certified Nursing Assistant. Becoming a CNA, in my opinion, is the first step towards the medical field because through this schooling I learned about basic patient care. I found that being hospitable, patient, and empathetic is very important to patients and helps them in receiving the care they need. I had hands-on experience at the Panorama Gardens Nursing and Rehabilitation Center. Shadowing a medical professional one day and having to perform skills the next day tested our skills which was very eye-opening because it's not as easy as it looks. The patient interaction is unpredictable because of their illnesses, but truthfully those illnesses do not define who they are. One thing we nurses encouraged, was self-care. If they resident thought they could perform a task without help, then they were given the opportunity to and were encouraged to do so. Prior to having real-patient interaction, I had to learn the skills in the schools laboratory using a mannequin. At the end of this course, I was given a written and skill-performance exam and passed. Even though my interests coinside with nursing, I thought that studying and earning a degree in microbiology would help me understand medical conditions more and maybe push me towards research. Obtaining a college degree in the sciences and achieving certifications in other medical professions such as LVN or RN, I hope will further my medical skills and knowledge and become an amazing health care professional. <br><br>
